Python package `auton_survival` provides a flexible API for various problems
in survival analysis, including regression, counterfactual estimation,
and phenotyping.

What is Survival Analysis?
--------------------------

**Survival Analysis** involves estimating when an event of interest, \( T \)
would take places given some features or covariates \( X \). In statistics
and ML these scenarious are modelled as regression to estimate the conditional
survival distribution, \( \mathbb{P}(T>t|X) \). As compared to typical
regression problems, Survival Analysis differs in two major ways:

* The Event distribution, \( T \) has positive support ie.
  \( T \in [0, \infty) \).
* There is presence of censoring ie. a large number of instances of data are
  lost to follow up.

Repository of reusable code utilities for Survival Analysis projects.

Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
---------------------------------

Helper functions to load various trial data like `TOPCAT`, `BARI2D` and `ALLHAT`.

```python
# Load the TOPCAT Dataset
from auton_survival import dataset
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()
```

### `auton_survival.preprocessing`
This module provides a flexible API to perform imputation and data
normalization for downstream machine learning models. The module has
3 distinct classes, `Scaler`, `Imputer` and `Preprocessor`. The `Preprocessor`
class is a composite transform that does both Imputing ***and*** Scaling.

```python
# Preprocessing loaded Datasets
from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.preprocessing import Preprocessing
features = Preprocessor().fit_transform(features,
					cat_feats=['GENDER', 'ETHNICITY', 'SMOKE'],
					num_feats=['height', 'weight'])

# The `cat_feats` and `num_feats` lists would contain all the categorical and numerical features in the dataset.

```


Survival Regression
-------------------

### `auton_survival.estimators`

This module provids a wrapper to model BioLINNC datasets with standard
survival (time-to-event) analysis methods.
The use of the wrapper allows a simple standard interface for multiple
different survival models, and also helps standardize experiments across
various differents research areas.

Currently supported Survival Models are:

- Cox Proportional Hazards Model (`lifelines`):
- Random Survival Forests (`pysurvival`):
- Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (`lifelines`) :
- Deep Survival Machines: **Not Implemented Yet**
- Deep Cox Mixtures: **Not Implemented Yet**


```python
# Preprocessing loaded Datasets
from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.estimators import Preprocessing
features = Preprocessing().fit_transform(features)
```


### `auton_survival.experiments`

Modules to perform standard survival analysis experiments. This module
provides a top-level interface to run `auton_survival` Style experiments
of survival analysis, involving cross-validation style experiments with
multiple different survival analysis models at different horizons of event times.

The module further eases evaluation by automatically computing the
*censoring adjusted* estimates of the Metrics of interest, like
**Time Dependent Concordance Index** and **Brier Score** with **IPCW** adjustment.

```python
# auton_survival Style Cross Validation Experiment.
from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.experiments import SurvivalCVRegressionExperiment

# instantiate an auton_survival Experiment by
# specifying the features and outcomes to use.
experiment = SurvivalCVRegressionExperiment(features, outcomes)

# Fit the `experiment` object with a Cox Model
experiment.fit(model='cph')

# Evaluate the performance at time=1 year horizon.
scores = experiment.evaluate(time=1.)

print(scores)
```


Phenotyping and Knowledge Discovery
-----------------------------------

### `auton_survival.phenotyping`


Reporting
----------

### `auton_survival.reporting`

Helper functions to generate standard reports for popular Survival Analysis problems.

## Installation

```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/autonlab/auton_survival
foo@bar:~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compatibility
-------------
`dsm` requires `python` 3.5+ and `pytorch` 1.1+.

To evaluate performance using standard metrics
`dsm` requires `scikit-survival`.

Contributing
------------
`dsm` is [on GitHub]. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
